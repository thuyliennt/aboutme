Welcome to my webpage

In this project, I made up my webpage with four pages such as: index.html, research.html, teaching.html and contact.html. The home page (index.html) is short description about me. My favorite research and some reasearch paper are described in research.html file. The teaching.html and contact.html are some subjects and contact information respectively.

I used Bootstrap 4 and SCSS to decorate my website  beside using common.css file. You can find some examples of SCSS feature used in style.scss including: SCSS variable, SCSS nesting and SCSS inderitance. To adaptive with smaller screens, I used @media query to change font-size or hide the header title and rearrage social box on the top of the website.
